## **Project Title** :
## Prediction of Iris.csv dataset for decision tree algorithm using supervised learning machine algorithm.
## **Problem Statement** : 
## An American based botanical garden grow iris flower in their labs but using biotechnology in a single tree where different types of variety flowers in grown , as a data science engineer how much accuracy is there in all categories which contain same species.
